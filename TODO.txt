improve the XPATH queries to get less null data
maybe figure out a way to scrape from multiple channels at once?
a lot of the nulls are probably from subsequent messages not having the profile in the message, so i can just use the last result. so i should check that out maybe.
figure out an alternate way to detect if a message is a reply other than just checking if it starts with a @
figure out the emoji's name from the emoji <emoji /> on my find_body() function
maybe make images like <image href="..." />. so as in like it looks on the source code. Or maybe something better. Maybe just the href link is fine too.
